# Balatro Shenanigans Mod
This mod currently adds 12 decks to the game. You can either discover the effects yourself or read below for each deck's description. Requires Steamodded v0.9.8.


 - **Dusk Deck**: -1 hand per round, but each final hand is retriggered twice
 - **Hieroglyph Deck**: Start at ante 0, but must reach ante 10 to win.
 - **Showman Deck**: Similar to the Showman Joker, but instead adds 10 copies of each card you own to the pool, so that they're notably more likely to appear.
 - **Gros Michel Deck**: +2 Joker slots and start with a Gros Michel, but each joker has the Gros Michel effect (1 in 6 chance to be destroyed at the end of each round, increased by Oops! All 6s)
 - **Turtle Bean Deck**: +5 hand size, this bonus decreases by 1 after each Boss Blind. The bonus does not go negative.
 - **Snakeskin Deck**: After play or discard, always draw 3 cards (constant effect of The Serpent boss blind).
 - **Canio's Deck**: Discarded cards have a 1 in 7 (increasable by Oops! All 6s) chance to be destroyed.
 - **Triboulet's Deck**: Start with 4 extra kings and queens of random suits.
 - **Yorick's Deck**: Discarded cards trigger their end of round effects. This works with Mime/Red Seal. This might not be compatible with certain mods.
 - **Chicot's Deck**: Selling any joker disables the current boss blind.
 - **Perkeo's Deck**: At the end of each Boss Blind, triggers the Perkeo effect.
 - **Freaky Deck**: Each Joker is assigned as a 'Freaky 6', or 'Freaky 9'. After scoring, any 'Freaky 6' adjacent to a 'Freaky 9' gives 1.5x mult.


I have begun testing the mod but not extensively, issues might appear, especially regarding higher stakes as I've only really tested them on white stake so far. I'm planning to try to reach gold stake with each deck and tweak the difficulty of any outliers.
