# Balatro Shenanigans Mod
This mod currently adds 12 decks to the game. You can either discover the effects yourself or read below for each deck's description.

 - **Dusk Deck**: -1 hand per round, but each final hand is retriggered twice
 - **Hieroglyph Deck**: Start at ante 0, but must reach ante 10 to win.
 - **Showman Deck**: If a card of a certain rarity would be generated and you already have a copy of it, there's a 1/9 chance (not adjustable by Oops! All 6s) that a duplicate will generate. This is similar to the effect of the Showman card, but it's slightly biased to give you duplicates, and will not generate two of the same card you don't own at once.
 - **Gros Michel Deck**: +2 Joker slots and start with a Gros Michel, but each joker has the Gros Michel effect (1 in 6 chance to be destroyed at the end of each round, increased by Oops! All 6s)
 - **Turtle Bean Deck**: +5 hand size, this bonus decreases by 1 after each Boss Blind. The bonus does not go negative.
 - **Snakeskin Deck**: After play or discard, always draw 3 cards (constant effect of The Serpent boss blind).
 - **Canio's Deck**: Discarded cards have a 1 in 7 (increasable by Oops! All 6s) chance to be destroyed.
 - **Triboulet's Deck**: Start with 4 extra kings and queens of random suits.
 - **Yorick's Deck** (WIP): Scored cards trigger their on discard effects, start with a Medium card. I initially tried to make played hands count as discards (to synergize with Burnt Joker, Yorick, etc) but have not managed to do that yet. I am thinking of a potential different effect.
 - **Chicot's Deck**: Selling any joker disables the current boss blind.
 - **Perkeo's Deck**: At the end of each Boss Blind, triggers the Perkeo effect.
 - **Freaky Deck**: Each Joker is assigned as a 'Freaky 6', or 'Freaky 9'. After scoring, any 'Freaky 6' adjacent to a 'Freaky 9' gives 1.5x mult.

I have begun testing the mod but not extensively, issues might appear, especially regarding higher stakes as I've only really tested them on white stake so far. I'm planning to try to reach gold stake with each deck and tweak the difficulty of any outliers.
